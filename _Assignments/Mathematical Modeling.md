 This course focuses on how to propose mathematical models from practical problems and how to solve practical problems through mathematical modeling.

**Question**
There is a hot drink with too high temperature and a glass of ice water. To drink the hot drink as soon as possible, you need to use ice water to cool the hot beverage. 
There are two cooling strategies:

1. Pour ice water into the hot drink immediately.
2. Wait for the hot drink to cool to a specific temperature, then pour the ice water into it.

By establishing a mathematical model find which strategy allows the hot drinks to cool as quickly as possible.
