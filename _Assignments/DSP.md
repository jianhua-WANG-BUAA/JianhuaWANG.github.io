**Theory:**

The main contents of this course include: time-domain, frequency-domain and Z-domain analysis methods for discrete-time signals and systems; sampling theory and application of discrete-time signals; basic concepts, calculation methods and typical applications of discrete Fourier transform; Filter architecture and design methods, the finite-length effect analysis of digital signal processing systems, and more.

**Experiment:**

1. Typical signal time domain analysis and processing experiment 
2. Frequency domain analysis and processing experiments of typical signals 
3. IIR and FIR digital filter design experiment 
4. Analysis and processing experiments of typical engineering signals
