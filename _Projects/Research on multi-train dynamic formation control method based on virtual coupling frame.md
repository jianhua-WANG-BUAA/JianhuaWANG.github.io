As the central nerve of the capital's transportation network, urban rail transit plays an important role in supporting the economic development of the capital. In order to further improve the service quality of the capital's urban rail transit and give full play to the advantages of multi-train coordinated operation, it is proposed to adopt multi-train formation control technology to ensure the efficient and orderly execution of tasks by multiple trains. Multiple trains dynamically adjust the relative distance between them through virtual linkage. On the basis of ensuring the safety of multiple trains, it also improves the efficiency of coordinated operation of multiple trains and avoids the physical linkage between traditional multiple trains. , Centralized scheduling control and other issues.

This project intends to study the dynamic formation control method of multiple trains based on virtual connection. First of all, the modeling problem of multi-train distributed cooperative system is studied, the multi-train dynamic formation strategy based on virtual connection is proposed, and the configuration of multi-train dynamic formation controller is designed. Secondly, the influence of constraints such as time-varying formation, switching topology, and finite time on dynamic formation control is studied, and criteria for realizing multi-train dynamic formation control under multiple constraints are given. Finally, physical verification is carried out based on the self-developed cluster experimental platform, and related algorithms are verified and evaluated through dynamic formation control experiments.

## My work

In this project, my work mainly includes the following three parts:

1. I have participated in redacting the project application in the early stage.
2. I have designed the multi-train formation tracking control protocols under multiple constraints like switching topologies and time-delays.
3. I was responsible for constructing a multi-train formation demonstration platform based on Lego EV3.
