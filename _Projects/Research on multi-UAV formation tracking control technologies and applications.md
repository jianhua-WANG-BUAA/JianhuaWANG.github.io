## Background

<!-- 无人机是现代化战争中重要的作战装备之一。作为可靠的空中打击力量，高效的无人机作战往往可以决胜于千里之外。无人机集群具有自主化与智能化特点，在灵活性与可靠性等方面具有显著优势。在协同侦查打击任务中，多无人机可以充分发挥集群优势，对目标进行大范围搜索探测；当发现目标后，多无人机对目标进行多角度观测，并将多源感知信息进行融合处理；决策系统根据感知融合结果进行在线任务规划，制定出合理可行的飞行方案；多无人机以特定的编队构型保持对目标轨迹的跟踪，最后在恰当的时机对目标进行集群打击。 -->

UAV is one of the important combat equipment in modern warfare. As a reliable air strike force, efficient UAV combat can often win the battle thousands of miles away. UAV clusters have the characteristics of autonomy and intelligence, and have significant advantages in flexibility and reliability. In cooperative reconnaissance and strike missions, multiple drones can give full play to the advantages of clusters to search and detect targets in a large range; when the target is found, the multiple drones will observe the target from multiple angles and process the multi-source sensing information. ; The decision-making system conducts online mission planning based on the results of perception fusion, and formulates a reasonable and feasible flight plan; multiple drones keep track of the target trajectory in a specific formation configuration, and finally carry out a group attack on the target at the right time.

This project focuses on the problem of multi-UAV formation tracking control for maneuvering targets, and conducts in-depth research on adaptive formation tracking control methods. It is necessary to deal with the constraints of unknown target maneuvering acceleration, unknown global topology information, and limited target state observation. The formation tracking control problem is analyzed, and the formation tracking control algorithm is verified and evaluated by means of cluster experiments.
