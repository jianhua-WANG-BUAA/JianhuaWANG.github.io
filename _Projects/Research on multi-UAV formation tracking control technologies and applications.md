## Overview

Durationï¼šOct. 2017 - Jun. 2020

Advisorï¼šLiang HAN

This is my internship project, which aims to detect intrusion, line- crossing, running and falling behaviors automatically in surveillance videos through deep learning algorithms. Through this project, I am trying to reach the following learning objectives:


1. Design of the multi-UAV cooperative formation tracking controller.
2. Verification of the controller's stability via Matlab and Simulink simulations.
3. Construction of the multi-UAV virtual formation platform based on ROS and Gazebo simulator.
4. Development of a multi-UAV formation experimental platform based on the indoor positioning system.


This video presents the multi-UAV formation tracking experiments based on the ARDrone UAVs and formation experimental platform. ðŸ‘‡
