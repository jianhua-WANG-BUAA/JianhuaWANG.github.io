## Overview

Durationï¼šJun. 2019 - Sep. 2019

Advisorï¼š*Research associate* YUAN Fei

This is my internship project, which aims to detect intrusion, line- crossing, running and falling behaviors automatically in surveillance videos through deep learning algorithms. Through this project, I am trying to reach the following learning objectives:

1. Master the Python language and object-oriented programming (OOP) ideas.
2. Master the TensorFlow deep learning framework.
3. Understand frequently-used target detection algorithms, having implemented traditional algorithms including GMM and ViBe, machine learning algorithm HOG+SVM, and deep learning algorithm YOLOV3. Now the YOLOV3 algorithm for target detection.
4. Understand frequently-used target tracking algorithms. Currently the Deep Sort algorithm for target tracking.
5. Master methods for optimizing computing resources.

This video presents basic functions of this project. ðŸ‘‡

The code for the YOLOv3 algorithm and the Deep Sort algorithm refer to the following repositories: [Https://github.com/Qidian213/deep_sort_yolov3](Https://github.com/Qidian213/deep_sort_yolov3), [Https://github.com/YunYang1994/tensorflow-yolov3](Https://github.com/YunYang1994/tensorflow-yolov3) and [Https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort](Https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort). Owing to these projects! I hope that one day, I could contribute to the open-source community like them.

I tried to train a classifier to identify the falling behaviors based on target detection. However, my samples gathered from YouTube resulted in poor generalization performance.

P.S. I found that YunYang posted a code analysis of YOLOV3. If you are interested, you can go to: [https://github.com/YunYang1994/CodeFun/blob/master/005-paper_reading/YOLOv3.md](https://github.com/YunYang1994/CodeFun/blob/master/005-paper_reading/YOLOv3.md)
