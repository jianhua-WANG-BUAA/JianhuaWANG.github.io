## Background

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Much attention has been paid to the detection of explosive compounds in antiterrorism applications. 
Facing the increasing demand for trace explosive detection, the company plans to employ UAVs equipped with explosive detection device to realize the detection of dangerous goods in a larger range with high crowd density. In order to initially verify the feasibility of the idea, it is planned to use Gazebo virtual simulation software to construct a UAV trace explosive detection scenario, where multi-UAV systems are controlled to realize a time-varying formation to cover a larger detection range.

## Intership content


Specific internship content includes three parts:

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
First, learn to use Gazebo virtual simulation software, and construct a trace explosive detection scenario in Gazebo world.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Second, use the reinforcement learning method based on dynamic Q-learning to train the fixed-point tracking algorithm of the single UAV control.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Third, based on the swarm control technology, design a multi-UAV intelligent formation control algorithm to realize the dynamic formation of multiple UAVs, and then use the multi-UAV formation to achieve a larger range of explosive detection. The multi-UAV formation controller based on sliding mode control method and reinforcement learning algorithms are employed on the Gazebo explosives detection scenario, respectively.
