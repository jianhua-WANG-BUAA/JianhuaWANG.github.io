The unmanned swarm has the ability to emerge from the effective collaboration of individuals to achieve higher than individuals' swarm intelligence, and to complete combat tasks in complex environments. It is the driving engine for the intelligence of the military equipment system and will also subvert the future combat form. How to perform distributed collaborative perception and recognition, collaborative cognition and decision-making, and collaborative guidance and control based on swarm intelligence technology is the key to improving the effectiveness of distributed collaborative operations in unmanned clusters, and it is also the core research field of a new generation of artificial intelligence.

Develop a virtual heterogeneous unmanned cluster attack and defense countermeasure simulation platform. The offensive and defensive sides have their own positions on the generated map. The participating teams develop a group intelligent collaborative algorithm, and use a certain number of drones and unmanned vehicles to cooperate with each other to collaboratively search, identify and destroy stationary and moving targets in the opponent's position. Coordinately intercept the opponent's drones and unmanned vehicles to protect your command post from being destroyed. Among them, UAVs have the ability to coordinate detection and multi-aircraft to destroy each other's UAVs; unmanned vehicles have the ability to coordinate detection and destruction of ground targets; the two can communicate and cooperate with each other.

## My work

1. Design of UAV/UGV air-ground cooperative countermeasure demonstration algorithms.
2. Construction of a virtual coordinated combat scenario based on Gazebo simulator.
3. Development and redaction of Matlab/Python control API demos.

## Achievements

This competition requires each team to design and manufacture an aircraft which should satisfy the following requirements:

1. Driven by an internal combustion engine

2.  Remotely controlled to take off from a specific area

3.  Carry an amount of water as load

4. Can release the load after flying to a certain height (18m) above the release area.

In this experience, I exercised my hands-on ability and realized my dream of making an airplane. More importantly, we worked as a team to achieve our collective goal; our journey together was truly unforgettable.
