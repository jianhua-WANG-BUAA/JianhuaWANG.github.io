Hello! My name is WANG Jianhua. I have received my B.E. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2018. I am currently a postgraduate student at [Centrale PÃ©kin](http://ecpknen.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. HAN Liang](https://www.hanliang.pro/), majoring in Automation and Reinforcement Learning.
My research interests include coopertive control of multi-agent systems, formation tracking control of multi-UAV systems, and reinforcement learning for multi-agent systems.

Believing in the principle of "**Learning by doing**", I participated in many projects in university. These projects are hard to be presented in words, so I created this site to **visualize** the  [Projects](https://lijinjie.top/Projects/) I've worked on.

In addition, I posted my reports of assignments in [Assignments](https://lijinjie.top/Assignments/) and photography works in [Portfolio](https://lijinjie.top/portfolio/), and you can contact me through [CV&Contact](https://lijinjie.top/cv/).
