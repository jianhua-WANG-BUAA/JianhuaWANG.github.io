I have excellent grades in school, optimistic, serious and responsible, strong teamwork ability, strong self-driving force, and love to try new things. I have received a complete European general engineer education, and am proficient in English and French bilingualism. I have a solid foundation in mathematics and physics, and have the ability to cross-integrate multi-disciplinary knowledge. 
I have the ability to use ROS-Gazebo for virtual simulation verification and the use of quadrotor UAVs for swarm experimental verification. I have a strong interest in intelligent control and automatic control and other related directions.

Believing in the principle of "**Learning by doing**", I participated in many projects in university. These projects are hard to be presented in words, so I created this site to **visualize** the  [Projects](https://lijinjie.top/Projects/) I've worked on.


In addition, I posted my reports of assignments in [Assignments](https://lijinjie.top/Assignments/) and photography works in [Portfolio](https://lijinjie.top/portfolio/), and you can contact me through [CV&Contact](https://lijinjie.top/cv/).
