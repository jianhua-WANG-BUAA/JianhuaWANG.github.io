I have excellent grades in school, optimistic, serious and responsible, strong teamwork ability, strong self-driving force, and love to try new things. I have received a complete <b>European general engineer education</b>, and am proficient in English and French bilingualism. I have a solid foundation in mathematics and physics, and have the ability to cross-integrate multi-disciplinary knowledge. 
I have the ability to use ROS-Gazebo for virtual simulation verification and the use of quadrotor UAVs for swarm experimental verification. I have a strong interest in intelligent control and automatic control and other related directions.

Believing in the principle of "<b>Learning by doing</b>", I participated in many projects in university. These projects are hard to be presented in words, so I created this site to <b>visualize</b> the <a href="https://jianhua-wang-buaa.github.io/Projects/">Projects</a> I've worked on.

Since the summer of 2018, I have been carrying out scientific research with Prof. HAN Liang in the Sino-French UAV Laboratory. During my master's degree, I have participated in many projects and have made some achievements in the field of multi-agent system cooperative control. You can find the research results in <a href="https://jianhua-wang-buaa.github.io/Publications/">Publications</a>, <a href="https://jianhua-wang-buaa.github.io/Publications/">Research</a>, and <a href="https://jianhua-wang-buaa.github.io/Publications/">Projects</a>.
